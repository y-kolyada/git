It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency (1). Git is a free and open-source software (1).

Git is a distributed version control system, which means that a local   clone of the project is a complete version control repository (3). These fully functional local repositories make it easy to work offline or remotely (3). Developers commit their work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server (3).
