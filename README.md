# Git FAQ

## Overview

### **What is Git?**

**Bing**

> Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source  code during software development1. It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency (1). Git is a free and open-source software (1).
> 
> When you make changes to a file, Git stores a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to that snapshot (2). Git is a distributed version control system, which means that a local   clone of the project is a complete version control repository (3). These fully functional local repositories make it easy to work offline or remotely (3). Developers commit their work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server (3).

### **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

**Bing**

> Git is a version control system that helps developers keep track of changes in their code (1). GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories (2). Essentially, GitHub facilitates the work of teams who use Git (1).
>
> Git is a tool that you can use to manage your source code history (3). It is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files (1). GitHub is a > hosting service for Git repositories (3). So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git (3).

## The architecture of Git

### **What are the basic architectural components of Git?**

**Bing**
> Git has three main components: the working directory, the staging area, and the repository (1). The working directory is where you make changes to your files. The staging area is where you prepare your changes for the next commit. The repository is where Git stores all the versions of your files (2).

3. [docs.gitlab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/architecture.html)


### **What is a directory in Git in detail?**

**Bing**
> In Git, a directory is a folder that contains files and other directories. When you create a new repository in Git, it creates a directory with the same name as the repository (1). The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer (1). The working directory is the directory that holds the current checkout of the files you are working on (2).

### **What is a staging area in Git in detail?**

**Bing**
> The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the “index”, but the phrase “staging area” works just as well (1). The staging area is like a rough draft space, it’s where you can git add the version of a file or multiple files that you want to save in your next commit (in other words in the next version of your project) (2). The staging area is a fundamental part of version control and can be used effectively to make version control easier and uncomplicated (3).

### **What is a staging area in Git in detail?**

**Bing**
> In Git, a repository is a collection of files of various different versions of a project. These files are imported from the repository into the local server of the user for further updations and modifications in the content of the file (1). A Git repository is the .git/ folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time. Meaning, if you delete the .git/ folder, then you delete your project’s history (2). A repository contains all of your project’s files and each file’s revision history. You can discuss and manage your project’s work within the repository (3).

### **What is a local repository in Git in detail?**

**Bing**
> A Git local repository is the one on which we will make local changes, typically this local repository is on our computer (1). Git remote repository is the one of the server, typically a machine situated at some distance away. Git has two repository types: local and remote. The local repo is on your computer for only your direct use. The remote repo is typically elsewhere and for your indirect use (2). You typically obtain a Git repository in one of two ways: You can take a local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or You can clone an existing Git repository from elsewhere. In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work (3).

### **What is a remote repository in Git in detail?**

**Bing**
> In Git, a remote repository is a shared repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. It is stored on a code hosting service like an internal server, GitHub, Subversion, and more (1)(2). A remote URL is Git’s fancy way of saying “the place where your code is stored.” That URL could be your repository on GitHub, or another user’s fork, or even on a completely different server (3).

### **What is a commit in Git?**

**Bing**
> In Git, a commit is a snapshot of your project’s working directory at a specific point in time, taken by a specific author. Git keeps a record of all commits made in your project and uses this to build up a full history of every change ever made to each file (1). Git considers each commit change point or “save point”. It is a point in the project you can go back to if you find a bug, or want to make a change. When we commit, we should always include a message. By adding clear messages to each commit, it is easy for yourself (and others) to see what has changed and when (2).

### **How are commits stored in git?**

**Bing**
> Commits are stored in Git’s repository, also known as the object database (or object store). This resides in your project root at the path.git/objects/ (1). Git commits are stored the same way as all other Git objects such as blobs and trees. Git’s code builds up the commit in a memory buffer in the format shown above. Next, the OpenSSL SHA library is used to calculate the SHA-1 hash of the commit data (1). Every object that is stored in the object database gets stored by its SHA-1 hash (2).

4. [github.com](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit)


### **What is a blob object and where blob objects are stored in Git?**

**Bing**
> A Git blob (binary large object) is the object type used to store the contents of each file in a repository. Each version of a file in Git is represented as a blob. A blob holds a file’s data but doesn’t contain any metadata about the file or even its name (1). A blob in Git is just a file’s binary data, stored along with the size of that data and a label indicating the object’s type, which in this case is a 'blob’ (2). Because a blob is just a stream of binary data, it is also referred to as an octet stream or a byte stream (2).

### **What is a tree object and where tree objects are stored in Git?**

**Bing**
> A tree object, in Git, is an internal data structure that records a directory tree or sub-tree. It contains one entry per file or sub-directory (or, for submodules, a gitlink entry for that submodule). Each entry lists the file’s executable-mode bit, as a sort of yes or no flag that’s encoded weirdly, 1 plus the file’s name and blob hash ID (1). A tree object is a full Git object that is stored in the repository (2).

Tree objects are stored in Git’s repository, also known as the object database (or object store). This resides in your project root at the path .git/objects/ (2). Every object that is stored in the object database gets stored by its SHA-1 hash (2).
