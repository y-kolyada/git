# Git FAQ

## Overview

### **What is Git?**

**Bing**

> Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source  code during software development1. It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency (1). Git is a free and open-source software (1).
> 
> When you make changes to a file, Git stores a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to that snapshot (2). Git is a distributed version control system, which means that a local   clone of the project is a complete version control repository (3). These fully functional local repositories make it easy to work offline or remotely (3). Developers commit their work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server (3).

### **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

**Bing**

> Git is a version control system that helps developers keep track of changes in their code (1). GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories (2). Essentially, GitHub facilitates the work of teams who use Git (1).
>
> Git is a tool that you can use to manage your source code history (3). It is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files (1). GitHub is a > hosting service for Git repositories (3). So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git (3).

## The architecture of Git

### **What are the basic architectural components of Git?**

**Bing**
> Git has three main components: the working directory, the staging area, and the repository (1). The working directory is where you make changes to your files. The staging area is where you prepare your changes for the next commit. The repository is where Git stores all the versions of your files (2).

### **What is a directory in Git in detail?**

**Bing**
> In Git, a directory is a folder that contains files and other directories. When you create a new repository in Git, it creates a directory with the same name as the repository (1). The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer (1). The working directory is the directory that holds the current checkout of the files you are working on (2).

### **What is a staging area in Git in detail??**

**Bing**
> The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the “index”, but the phrase “staging area” works just as well (1). The staging area is like a rough draft space, it’s where you can git add the version of a file or multiple files that you want to save in your next commit (in other words in the next version of your project) (2). The staging area is a fundamental part of version control and can be used effectively to make version control easier and uncomplicated (3).
