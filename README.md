# Git FAQ

## Main concepts

### **What is Git?**

**Bing**

> Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source  code during software development1. It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency (1). Git is a free and open-source software (1).
> 
> When you make changes to a file, Git stores a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to that snapshot (2). Git is a distributed version control system, which means that a local   clone of the project is a complete version control repository (3). These fully functional local repositories make it easy to work offline or remotely (3). Developers commit their work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server (3).

### **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**

**Bing**

> Git is a version control system that helps developers keep track of changes in their code (1). GitHub, on the other hand, is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories (2). Essentially, GitHub facilitates the work of teams who use Git (1).
>
> Git is a tool that you can use to manage your source code history (3). It is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files (1). GitHub is a > hosting service for Git repositories (3). So they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git (3).
